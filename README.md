# MPSM_SKR_Mini
# Configuration file for the Monoprice Select Mini V2 using a BTT SKR Mini E3 V3 main board (MainsailOS/Klipper)
# and uart connection.
# This configuration file was created using the preconfigured example file from the 
# BigTreeTech/BIGTREETECH-SKR-mini-E3 github page to get the pin designations 
# correct for the SKR main board, and the Klipper example configuration file for the MPSM from the 
# Klipper3d/klipper/config github page to provide the correct settings. 
# As I used MainsailOS as my UT, I followed the MainsailOS and Klipper instructions for installation and 
# creation of the printer.cfg file from this configuration.
# I am not the originator of any of the code in this printer.cfg file, as stated above. Please follow all
# installation and testing instructions provided in the MainsailOS and Klipper documentation.
